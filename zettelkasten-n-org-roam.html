<h2 id="org8e1cc1e">Why Taking Notes At All</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org8e1cc1e">
<p>
I started taking notes when I was in elementary school. I am absolutely
convinced that it is a good habit in learning new subjects.
</p>

<p>
The action of writing things down involves multiple senses working together
to create stronger memory.
</p>

<p>
Taking notes in your own words forces you to think deeply about the ideas
beyond the passages. To truly understand an idea is not the same as to merely
comprehend the written text itself. The &rsquo;translation&rsquo; process is the essence
of note-taking. It integrates the newly-learned idea with your existing
knowledge network. The benefit of linking your knowledge is more like compound
interests instead of linear addition. On the other hand, copying text word by
word doesn&rsquo;t automatically make you understand the ideas.
</p>

<p>
Taking notes in meetings and conversations help us concentrate and avoid
daydreaming, this is particularly useful in the age of working remotely with
back-to-back Zoom calls.
</p>

<p>
Notes crystallise our thoughts in the precise moment when they emerge. Any
form of coming-back-later is a waste of time. Repetition doesn&rsquo;t guarantee
better understanding of the ideas because <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias#:~:text=Confirmation%20bias%20is%20the%20tendency,evidence%2Dbased%20decision%2Dmaking.">our memory is very selective</a>. The
action of highlighting-for-later is the same as putting things on your
back-burner. It&rsquo;s better to deal with them now or discard them completely.
Wasting mental energy to manage more back-burners is counterproductive. Our
short-term memory and focus are all limited, overloading them will only cause
us stress.
</p>

<p>
Taking notes empties our short-term memory. This means we can use our main
focus to think about the order, the relationship and the clarity between the
ideas we are trying to make sense of. Writing down thoughts doesn&rsquo;t mean we
are going to forget about what we have learned. The action of linking the
ideas strengthens our understanding. The idea of freeing out short-term
memory is also used in David Allen&rsquo;s book <i>Getting Things Done</i>.
</p>

<p>
However, I always felt I am not taking notes the right way, or perhaps I just
have really bad memroy. There are times I couldn&rsquo;t remember much about the
books I&rsquo;ve spent days reading about a couple of months ago. The volumes of
notebooks on my bookshelf often felt foreign to me, as if they were from
somebody else.
</p>

<p>
It all changed when I learned about Zettlekasten.

<h2 id="org676c69c">What is Zettelkasten</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org676c69c">
<p>
Zettelkasten (German: &ldquo;slip-box&rdquo;) is a note taking method for knowledge
management and writing. It is what made Niklas Luhmann, a self-made public
servant to sociologist professor who wrote 58 books and over 400 papers
during his lifetime - with more published based on his manuscripts after his
death, a prolific scholar. Zettelkasten seems to have gained popularity in
the past few years, especially with the popular not-taking application <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam
Research</a>.
</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
As a result of extensive work with this technique a kind of secondary memory
will arise, an alter ego with who we can constantly communicate. It proves to
be similar to our own memory in that it does not have a thoroughly
constructed order of its entirety, not hierarchy, and most certainly no
linear structure like a book. Just because of this, it gets its own life,
independent of its author.
</p>

<p>
&#x2014; Niklas Luhmann
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>
The idea of communicating with your second brain is very powerful. It&rsquo;s like
you have a Google with all your own ideas and writings. I find it&rsquo;s
particularly interesting as it resonates with my idea of &rsquo;searching over
organising&rsquo;. I believe we should be able to have dialogues with our brain and
notebooks to ask questions.
</p>

<p>
The method itself is very simple to practice. You use small index cards for
note taking. Each card (&ldquo;Zettel&rdquo; in German) has an ID, a set of contexts
(tags) and references to other cards. All the cards are stored in a
slip-box. You then create indexes with key terms of important notes as entry
points for querying your knowledge (the second brain). Luhman also has a
slip-box dedicated for bibliography.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5Tst3-zcWI&amp;ab_channel=Zettlr">Zettelkasten Manifesto</a> explains the concept very well.
</p>
</div>

<section id="outline-container-org15d8443" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="org15d8443">Key Principles of Zettelkasten</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org15d8443">
<p>
In order to truly realise the effectiveness of the Zettelkasten method, there
are few key principles (or at least the ideas behind them) need to be
followed religiously.
</p>

<ul class="org-ul">
<li>Each card holds a single idea - an <b>atomic concept</b> that can be understood
by itself.  This makes each card useful in more than one context and it
increases the surface area for enquiry.</li>

<li>Use specific and contextual tags, avoid categories. &rsquo;Finance&rsquo; or &rsquo;Holiday&rsquo;
are not good tags in Zettelkasten. In what context would you want to find
information about &rsquo;Finance&rsquo;? It&rsquo;s too wide. A better version would be
&rsquo;Money Saving Tips&rsquo; or &rsquo;Places I Want to Visit in Africa&rsquo;. When you tag the
notes, don&rsquo;t automatically link them to the most obvious and most commonly
used tags. Think hard about in what contexts this note may be useful. This
deliberate practice of linking is the essence of Zettelkasten. The existing
keywords are warnings, they are not cues.</li>

<li>Build the links among cards through references. The practice of
deliberately building links helps you connect ideas. Building links from
bottom-up means you have to constantly update your links as you gain new
knowledge and insights.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="org556a11f">How to Take Smart Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org556a11f">
<p>
Apart from reading articles from <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/">zettelkasten.de</a>, I&rsquo;ve also read the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Take-Smart-Notes-Nonfiction-ebook/dp/B06WVYW33Y">How
to Take Smart Notes</a> from Sönke Ahrens. There are plenty of resources on the
Internet about Zettelkasten but none explains the idea as in depth as Ahrens&rsquo;
book.
</p>

<p>
The core idea of the book is that there are two parts in note-taking. The
first one is to write a summary of the main ideas in your own words. The
second part is to create links between the new ideas and the existing
concepts in your slip-box. They are equally important.
</p>

<p>
If you want to give the book a try, I recommend at least try Zettelkasten at
the same time while reading the book. I learnt about slip-boxes on the
Internet, bought the book and started to use the Zettelkasten method to read
this very book about Zettelkasten. I kept improving my Zettelkasten note
taking techniques as I went through the book. There were many aha moments
which I probably would not be able to get from reading the book for the first
time if I didn&rsquo;t practice this technique at all.
</p>

<p>
The book categorised notes into a few types. Below is my own interpretation
of how Zettels should be organised.
</p>

<section id="outline-container-orge812efc" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orge812efc">Five Types of Notes</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orge812efc">
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Fleeting notes</dt><dd>Your scrawls on serviettes, brown bags, or coffee shop
receipts. They are random ideas you jolted down while you were reading,
waiting in the queue or talking with a friend. Make sure you process them
within a day or two while the memory is still fresh. You can bin these
after you&rsquo;ve turned them into permanent notes.</dd>
</dl>
<dl class="org-dl">
<dt>Permanent notes</dt><dd>Notes that represent atomic ideas which can be understood
in their own contexts. I occasionally create notes only to connect related
ideas when they are too big to fit into one zettel. The title of the Zettel
should be descriptive. The first sentence or paragraph should be the summary
of the idea.</dd>

<dt>Literature notes</dt><dd>Summarise the content of a book, publication or blog
post and give the citation, in the format of &ldquo;on page X of Y, it says Z&rdquo;You
can keep a separate bibliography slip-box with tools such as <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zetora</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref">org-ref</a>.</dd>

<dt>Index notes</dt><dd>Index notes are the entry points to the universe inside your
slip-box. Each index should link as few notes as possible (Luhmann links
maximum three). Index notes are not tables of contents which have links to
everything in the slip-box. The key idea is to use the key links to discover
more notes by traversing through the network.  If you use a digital
Zettelkasten system this type of notes may not be necessary - back-links can
be discovered by the software easily</dd>

<dt>Project notes</dt><dd>Notes that serve as &rsquo;folders&rsquo; for specific projects. You
can archive them or bin them once the projects are done. You draw ideas
from your permanent notes but you don&rsquo;t change them for the projects - keep
the modifications for the project specific context inside the project
notes.</dd>

As a dedicated Emacser, the first thought in my mind was that I have to
implement the idea with Emacs. Fortunately you have the wonderful
<a href="https://github.com/org-roam/org-roam">Org-Roam</a>. It&rsquo;s straightforward to <a href="https://blog.jethro.dev/posts/how_to_take_smart_notes_org/">get started</a>.
</p>


<p>
This article itself is a result of my Zettelkasten with Org-Roam. This wonderful
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvWic15iXjk&amp;ab_channel=NatEliason">video</a> taught me how to outline an article with Zettels in 20 minutes.
